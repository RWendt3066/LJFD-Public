   "Article":"MN Department of Natural Resources - NEWS RELEASE<br /><br />Fire danger in most of Minnesota is expected to increase rapidly in the coming week, as the snow continues to melt and winds dry the dead standing grass and brush in open areas. Because of this danger, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will place burning restrictions over much of the state starting March 26, with more areas included later.<br/><br/>Spring fire restrictions limit open burning until summer green-up occurs. Traditionally, most wildfires in Minnesota occur during April and May. More that 95 percent of these fires are caused by human error.<br/><br />'Because of the high fire incidence during this time period, the DNR proactively initiates burning restrictions,' said DNR Fire Prevention Coordinator Larry Himanga.<br/><br />The restrictions normally last from four to six weeks until sufficient green vegetative growth occurs. Spring fire restrictions have resulted in a dramatic decrease in both the numbers and sizes of accidental fires, Himanga said.<br/><br />The burning restrictions mean the state will not give out burning permits for burning brush or yard waste.<br/><br />The following counties will be included in the initial burning restrictions this spring: Aitkin, Anoka, Becker, southern Beltrami (that portion south of Hwy 1), Benton, Carlton, Cass, Chisago, Clearwater, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Hennepin, Hubbard, Isanti, Itasca, Kanabec, Kittson, Manhomen, Marshall, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Otter Tail, Pennington, Pine, Polk (that portion south and east of cnty Rd 6 from the Manhomen County line to MN Hwy 92 east to the Clearwater County line), Pope, Ramsey, Roseau (that portion west of Hwy 89), Sherburne, Stearns, Todd, Wadena, Washington, and Wright. More counties will be added as spring weather conditions warrant.<br />Campfires are still allowed. Campers should watch their fire continuously and make sure it is out and cold to the touch before leaving the area.<br/><br />Fire conditions may change quickly over the next few weeks. More information including maps and fire condisions is available <a  href='http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/fire/firerating_restrictions.html' target='_blank'>online</a>"

   "Heading":"New Engine Ordered for Station 2", 
   "Article":"A new Engine has been ordered for Lake Johanna Fire Department Station #2 to replace the current Engine 2 which has been in operation since 1985.  The new Engine will be a 2012 Rosenbauer Custom Chassis with the body built by General Safety.  The Lake Johanna Truck Committee has worked very hard on the custom design of this truck and believe it will certainly be the best and most logically thought out truck in the fleet to date.  There will be room for a total of 5 firefighters in the cab area plus integrated medical/storage cabinets accessible from both the rear crew area and from outside doors.  The Engine will have a 900 gallon tank equipped with a 1250 GPM pump and a FoamPro Class 'A' foam system.  To provide for a neat and clean look, the ladder rack was lowered so it is no taller than the cab and is behind a side body panel.  The rear discharges have also been placed behind roll-up doors.  The Engine will include a manually operated deck gun built into the body as well as 360 degree scene lighting.  Based on lessons learned from last year's ice storm, auto-chains will be install on the truck's rear axle and can be engaged when road conditions warrant their use.  The current delivery timeline is set for April 2012.  However, since this is a new chassis, one of the first 5-10 built for production, some delays are anticipated."
