	<p>Public education is an important part of the Lake Johanna Fire Department mission.  As members of the communities that we serve, preserving the quality of life in these communities is very important to us.  We believe preserving the quality of life for our communities begins with the education of the individual citizens regarding the dangers of fire and other life threatening hazards.  One way we do this is through the participation in major community events as well as small group events.</p>
