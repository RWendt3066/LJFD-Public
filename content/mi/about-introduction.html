		 <p>The Lake Johanna Fire Department, organized in 1943, is a private non-profit organization providing fire protection services to the Cities of Arden Hills, North Oaks, and Shoreview, Minnesota. The Department covers 36 square miles and protects a population of about 41,000 residents. </p>
         <br />
		 <p>It has been nearly 70 years and our Department has undergone many changes. It all started with a small group of dedicated volunteers, a single bay station, and one truck.  Today LJFD is housed at 4 station, with a fleet of 16 vehicles, and employ 4 full-time staff members consisting of a Fire Chief, Assistant Chief, Fire Marshal, and Office Manager as well as about 60 paid on-call firefighters.  The one thing that has not changed is our commitment to provide the very best service possible for our community.</p>
