	<ul class="niceList">
	   <li>The fire can be no larger than 3 feet by 3 feet, and no higher than 3 feet.</li>
	   <li>The fire must be constructed in a fire "ring" or pit at least 25 feet away from any combustible material or structure.</li>
	   <li>The wind speed must be below 10 miles per hour.</li>
	   <li>Flammable liquids or accelerant cannot be used to start any recreational fire.</li>
	   <li>Any person planning to have a recreational fir must be aware of any local burning bans that are in effect.  If a burning ban is in effect than all recreational fires are prohibited.</li>
	   <li>Any open burning is restricted to vegetative, non-polluting material, which cannot be practically conposted or chipped. <b>Only clean natural wood can be burned.</b> Treated or painted wood, plastic, rubber, leaves and grass are not allowed.</li>
	   <li>Buckets, shovels, garden hoses or a fire extinguisher with a minimum 4-A rating shall be readily available for use at recreational fires.</li>
	   <li>A person knowledgeable in the use of fire extinguishing equipment shall constantly attend the fire. An attendant shall supervise a recreational fire until such fire has been completely extinguished.</li>
	   <li>The fire department is authorized to require that recreational fires be immediately discontinued if the fire department determines that smoke emissions are offensive to occupants of surrounding property or if the fire is determined to constitute a hazardous condition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violation of any of the above rules will result in the immediate extinguishment of the fire.  These and ony other violations of the open burning laws could result in loss of the right to have recreational fires and also may cause a citation, with fines up to $150 or more, to be written.</p>
